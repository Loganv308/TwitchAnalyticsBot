## TwitchAnalyticsBot

TwitchAnalyticsBot is an under-development Javascript program that has been used to log chat messages in real-time from one or more twitch.tv livestream.

This program was originally developed back in ~2021 using very rough Javascript code, not my favorite language, but it worked well with the Twitch.tv API. I picked it back up late 2024 and since then, this project has been and revised and refactored many times over...

The intent and purpose of this project has been to make query-able databases for analytical purposes on something I indulge in commonly, Twitch livestreams. 

Feel free to contribute code and add to this project as it's been a passion project for many months now to which I'm actively contributing.
