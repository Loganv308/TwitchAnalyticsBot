## TwitchAnalyticsBot

TwitchAnalyticsBot is a JavaScript-based application currently in development, designed to log chat messages in real-time from one or more Twitch.tv livestreams.

Originally created around 2021, the initial version was built using a basic JavaScript implementation. While JavaScript is not my preferred language, it provided effective integration with the Twitch API. In late 2024, I resumed work on the project, and since then, it has undergone multiple rounds of refactoring and improvement.

The primary goal of this project is to create a queryable database for analytical insights into Twitch livestreamsâ€”a platform I frequently engage with.

This has been a long-running passion project, and I continue to actively maintain and develop it. Contributions are welcome and encouraged.
