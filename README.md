## TwitchAnalyticsBot

TwitchAnalyticsBot is an under-development Javascript program that has been used to log chat messages in real-time from one or more twitch.tv livestream.

The logged messages are then added to a SQLlite database created also by the program. From here, the messages can be queryed and used for analytical purposes.
